# MKWHD-Installer
A simple linux and now windows python script to install [Mario Kart Wii HD Remaster](https://gamebanana.com/mods/49179) to your mario kart ISO without CTGP, so it works on dolphin

please let me know if you have any issues and ill fix it as quick as i can
I plan on making this work for more mods that do this kind of thing. ive seen too many pages where people are manually replacing up to 700 files haha

## Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS DOES NOT SUPPLY AN ISO, I DO NOT CONDONE PIRACY**


This is far from perfect, and comes without any warranty, give any script a read before you run it on your system!

This can be rather slow if your pc uses a HDD. This copies every file to every folder and then removes unneccesary files, so this is slow if youre not using an SSD or are using a huge mod. 
The main purpose of this is to remove the hassle of manually replacing files

This will also download WIT (for unpacking/packing your iso), and the mod. its fairly big so it might take a while on slower connections



## Running :zap:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have patool installed with ``pip install patool`` ‚ö†Ô∏è
- download `mkwhdwii-installer.py` from this repo
- simply run ``python mkhdwii-installer.py`` in a terminal
- Follow the instructions presented in your terminal



## issues/plans üõ†Ô∏è

- Itll install things before asking for your mario kart iso, this is usually fine on a fast internet connection but i plan to update it so that it asks for your paths before downloading so you dont have to babysit it
- I plan to make this work for other "My Stuff" CTGP mods, this mainly only works for MKWHD right now but you could definitely modify the script easily for anything else
- this is a quick script and theres a lot i could tidy up right now and i plan to when i get the motivation


## Support ‚≠ê

- Support this project by reporting any issues and your STARS 
- If theres a lot of movement in this repo or any issues, ill work on it a lot more and really tidy it up.
- This is what works for me and im hoping it works for you
