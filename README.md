# MKWHD-Installer
A simple linux bash script to install https://gamebanana.com/mods/49179 to your mario kart ISO without CTGP, so it works on dolphin

This is just a quick script i made to install this mod to a mario kart iso (not supplied)
everything is downloaded right next to the file, it copies all of the mod files to directories where some of the files are supposed to be and then deletes the unneeded files
its somewhat brute forcing it haha, so sorry if you have a HDD

Ill be improving on it, theres a good amount i can improve on but right now its usable



To use it open up a terminal, make it executable and run the file, itll download WIT, for extracting/combining the mario kart iso. then itll install the mod from gamebanana.
after thats all downloaded you need to type in the path to your mario kart iso, i just put mine right next to the bash file and type the name + extension (so id type mariokart.iso)
if the file exists it should all work okay.



please let me know if you have any issues and ill fix it as quick as i can
I plan on making this work for more mods that do this kind of thing. ive seen too many pages where people are manually replacing up to 700 files haha
